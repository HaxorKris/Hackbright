# 1. read the file (done)
# 2. copy the file into a single string/variable )done)
# 3. close the file (done)
# 4. split the string into words (done)
# 5. identify the number of words in the new list (done)
# 6. crawl through the list and pair:
# word 1 + word 2
# if this doesn't exist as a tuple already, add it, with the third word as a value
# if this does exist as a tuple already, append the next word to the value list
