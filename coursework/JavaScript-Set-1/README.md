### Running your code

For these exercises, you'll need to run your javascript files using the node.js binary.  This is similar to how we ran python files in the past. Just run `node file.js` and look for the output.

### Doing these at home

Most operating systems don't come with node.js installed by default. You'll need to install node.js to run these files from your command line. If you're on OSX and have homebrew installed, just run `brew install node` to get everything setup. If you don't have a mac or homebrew, go to nodejs.org and download the installer.

Once this is done, run `node --version` to ensure node was setup correctly.
