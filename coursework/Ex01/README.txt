Exercise 1

DESCRIPTION:

Write a program named guess.py that plays the 'number guessing game'. The computer will choose a random number between 1 and 100, and ask the user to guess the number, giving them a hint if it's high or low. 

A rough pseudocode outline of the program will look like this:

-------
greet player
get player name
choose random number between 1 and 100
while True:
    get guess
    if guess is incorrect:
        give hint
    else:
        congratulate player
